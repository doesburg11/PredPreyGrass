# Stepwise Summary of the `step` Function in `predpreygrass_rllib_env.py`

This document provides a detailed, structured breakdown of the `step` function in the `PredPreyGrass` environment (located in `walls_occlusion_correct_termination/predpreygrass_rllib_env.py`). The function implements the RLlib multi-agent step protocol, handling agent actions, environment updates, and output construction.

---

## Overview
The `step` function advances the environment by one timestep, processing agent actions, updating the world state, handling agent lifecycles (including deaths and reproduction), and returning the required RLlib outputs: observations, rewards, terminations, truncations, and infos.

---
### Remarks from the RLlib site:

https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib/rllib-env.html:
"Multi-agent setups aren’t vectorizable yet. The Ray team is working on a solution for this restriction by using the gymnasium >= 1.x custom vectorization feature." <== What does this mean?

https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib/multi-agent-envs.html
"To define, which agent IDs might even show up in your episodes, set the self.possible_agents attribute to a list of all possible agent ID."

"In case your environment only starts with a subset of agent IDs and/or terminates some agent IDs before the end of the episode, you also need to permanently adjust the self.agents attribute throughout the course of your episode."

"Next, you should set the observation- and action-spaces of each (possible) agent ID in your constructor. Use the self.observation_spaces and self.action_spaces attributes to define dictionaries mapping agent IDs to the individual agents’ spaces"

"In general, the returned observations dict must contain those agents (**and only those agents**) that should act next. Agent IDs that should NOT act in the next step() call must NOT have their observations in the returned observations dict." => This makes turn based
simulation possible"

## Stepwise Breakdown

### 1. **Profiling Start**
- Records the start time for profiling step duration.

### 2. **Initialize Output Containers**
- Initializes empty dictionaries for `observations`, `rewards`, `terminations`, `truncations`, and `infos`.
- Clears per-step info structures (e.g., `self.agents_just_ate`, `self._pending_infos`).

### 3. **Truncation Check (Early Return)**
- Calls `_check_truncation_and_early_return` to determine if the episode should be truncated (e.g., max steps reached).
- If truncated, returns the output tuple immediately with appropriate flags for all agents.

### 4. **Energy Decay**
- Calls `_apply_energy_decay_per_step` to decrement energy for all active agents according to their type.
- Updates per-agent energy and logs changes if verbose.

### 5. **Age Update**
- Calls `_apply_age_update` to increment the age of all active agents.

### 6. **Grass Regeneration**
- Calls `_regenerate_grass_energy` to increase the energy of all grass patches, capped at a maximum value.

### 7. **Agent Movements**
- Calls `_process_agent_movements` to update agent positions based on their actions.
- Handles movement energy costs, blocked moves (e.g., by walls or line-of-sight), and updates grid state.

### 8. **Agent Engagements (Interactions)**
- Precomputes position-to-agent mappings for prey and grass for efficient lookup.
- Iterates over all agents to process interactions:
  - **Predators**: May catch prey at their position (calls `_handle_predator_engagement`).
  - **Prey**: May eat grass at their position (calls `_handle_prey_engagement`).
- Updates rewards, energy, and termination flags as appropriate.
- Logs profiling information for engagement steps if debug mode is enabled.

### 9. **Agent Removals (Deaths)**
- Iterates over a copy of `self.agents` to remove agents that have been terminated (e.g., due to energy depletion or being eaten).
- Updates counters and removes agent data from all relevant structures.

### 10. **Agent Reproduction (Spawning New Agents)**
- Iterates over a copy of `self.agents` to process reproduction for eligible agents:
  - **Predators**: Calls `_handle_predator_reproduction`.
  - **Prey**: Calls `_handle_prey_reproduction`.
- Handles cooldowns, mutation, available slots, and energy transfer to offspring.
- Registers new agents and updates all relevant state.

### 11. **Observation Generation**
- After all state changes, generates new observations for all active agents by calling `_get_observation`.

### 12. **Output Construction**
- Filters and constructs output dictionaries for only currently active agents:
  - `observations`, `rewards`, `terminations`, `truncations`.
- Sets global `__all__` flags for truncation and termination.
- Builds `infos` for each agent from per-step info.
- Sorts `self.agents` for debugging consistency.

### 13. **Per-Step Data Logging**
- Collects and stores per-step agent data (positions, energy, deltas, age, offspring info) for later analysis or output.
- Clears per-agent step deltas.

### 14. **Step Counter Increment**
- Increments the environment's step counter.

### 15. **Profiling Summary**
- Logs a summary of timing for each major step section if debug mode is enabled.

### 16. **Return**
- Returns the tuple `(observations, rewards, terminations, truncations, infos)` as required by the RLlib protocol.

## Notes on Protocol Compliance
- The function ensures that terminated agents are included in the output for the step in which they are removed, with their final rewards and done flags.
- The mutation of `self.agents` (removal of dead agents, addition of offspring) occurs within the step function, in line with RLlib's expectations for agent lifecycle management.
- Output dictionaries are filtered to include only currently active agents, except for the step in which an agent is terminated.
