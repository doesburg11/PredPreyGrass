# Experiment Plan
Compare A (current rewards) vs B (adds Tier-1 lineage reward).
Hold env seeds/config equal; run n>=5 eval seeds per condition.

Primary outcomes:
- ↑ kin clustering (A→B)?
- ↑ correlation between kin density and survival/offspring (A→B)?
- Lineage frequency shifts > null (shuffle control)?

Knobs: μ=0.005 mutation rate; W=2000; α=0.1; R=2; equalize starting shares.
