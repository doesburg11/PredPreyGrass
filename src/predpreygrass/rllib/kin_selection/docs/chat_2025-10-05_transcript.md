## Conversation timeline (reconstructed)

### 1) Kickoff: Selfish Gene & cooperation
- [User] I want to build “Selfish Gene” lineage reward and cooperation metrics/plots. Add LOS/kin features and expose them online/offline.
- [Assistant] Proposed plan: add lineage reward (Tier‑1), LOS-aware observations and kin-energy channel, and an explicit SHARE action (prey-first) for measurable cooperation. Add online callback metrics and offline evaluator/plots with bootstrap CIs.

### 2) Implementation pass: selfish_gene → kin_selection
- [Assistant] Implemented evaluator and plotter with confidence intervals; created online metrics callback; documented the workflow.
- [Assistant] Migrated to a kin_selection variant: heritable types (type_1/type_2), a lineage reward toggle, SHARE action, and per-type metrics to enable 2×2 lineage/share experiments.

### 3) Debugging RLlib new API and observations
- [User] Encountered errors with Dict observations (encoder/permute issues).
- [Assistant] Workaround: pass Box-only obs to RLModule, disable action_mask in env config. Adjust callbacks to be robust to list/dict infos.

### 4) Training behavior and resume workflow
- [User] Training sometimes shows worker deaths (np.stack mismatch); trial appears to recover.
- [Assistant] Noted Tune’s recovery behavior, advised keeping obs shapes stable and runners limited. Added a resume script using `Tuner.restore` with options for unfinished/errored trials; documented run steps.

### 5) Documentation and results
- [Assistant] Added README rationale for explicit SHARE and for two heritable types; created `results.md` with screenshots in `assets/images/kin_selection`; updated paths.
- [User] Asked: “Why no type_2 in TensorBoard?”
- [Assistant] Explained that zero initial actives means no policy module is created—ensure non-zero initial actives for type_2 to get policies and metrics.

### 6) Per-type metrics and routing
- [Assistant] Extended `HelpingMetricsCallback` to include per-type helping/attempts/received, shares_to_same/other, and fraction_type_2 population metrics. Safeguarded parsing of `info` dictionaries/lists. Added `CombinedCallbacks` wrapper.

### 7) Offline evaluation and plotting
- [Assistant] Created/evolved `analysis/eval_checkpoints_helping.py` and `analysis/plot_helping_time_series.py` for checkpoint evaluation with bootstrap CIs and time-series plots. Added commands to `RUN_GUIDE.md` for train/resume/tensorboard/offline tooling.

### 8) Interpreting dynamics
- [User] Noted helping ramps and step-like jumps in two-type runs; asked why jumps happen and why a later downshift occurs.
- [Assistant] Explained threshold effects (eligibility windows, LOS, energy thresholds), batched PPO update dynamics, and positive feedback; downshift likely due to ecological changes or eligibility shifts.

### 9) Hypotheses about survival vs reproduction
- [User] Asked whether heavy sharing increases survival.
- [Assistant] Clarified that prey death is via predation/starvation; predation historically dominates. Proposed logging death-cause and lifespan metrics to validate mechanism; suggested adding births_per_episode and avg_prey_lifespan online/offline.

### 10) Run/Env configuration checks
- [Assistant] Audited `config_env_kin_selection.py` and base config for per-type readiness: lineage reward enabled, prey-only SHARE with kin-only routing, LOS respected, Box-only obs to RLModule, action mask disabled for stability, kin-energy channel enabled.
- [User] Tried running training and hit `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ray'`.
- [Assistant] Advised using the project’s conda environment Python when running scripts; provided guidance in RUN_GUIDE.

### 11) Follow-ups suggested
- [Assistant] Optional helpers vs non-helpers experiment via per-type SHARE toggle; add online death-cause/lifespan metrics; consider reintroducing action masks later with stable encoders/connectors; add VS Code tasks.

### 12) Artifacts and paths (as discussed)
- Env (latest lineage/kin): `src/predpreygrass/rllib/v3_1/predpreygrass_rllib_env.py`
- Networks: `src/predpreygrass/rllib/v3_1/utils/networks.py`
- Config: `config_env_kin_selection.py`, `config_env_base.py`
- Training/resume: `tune_ppo_kin_selection.py`, `resume_tune_ppo_kin_selection.py`
- Callbacks: `utils/helping_metrics_callback.py`, `utils/combined_callbacks.py`
- Offline: `analysis/eval_checkpoints_helping.py`, `analysis/plot_helping_time_series.py`
- Docs: `kin_selection/README.md`, `RUN_GUIDE.md`, `results.md`

## Open questions and next steps
- Do you want me to add death-cause and lifespan metrics now (online + offline)?
- Should I implement a per-type SHARE toggle for a helpers vs non-helpers prey A/B experiment?
- Would you like VS Code tasks added for one-click train/resume/eval?
