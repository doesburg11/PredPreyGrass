[ISXB-920](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-920)\n- Fixed an issue where ButtonStates are not fully updated when switching SingleUnifiedPointer. [ISXB-1356](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1356)\n- Fixed errors when pasting composite parts into non-composites. [ISXB-757](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-757)\n\n### Changed\n- Changed enum value `Key.IMESelected` to obsolete which was not a real key. Please use the ButtonControl `imeSelected`.\n\n### Added\n- Added support of F13-F24 keys. [UUM-44328](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-44328)"
