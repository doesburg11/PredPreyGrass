# What's new in version 1.2.0

- Added a new import mode, Tile Set, which imports tile data from Aseprite and generates Unity Tilemap assets on import.
- Added support for a parameter in the generated animation events.
- Added a choice on how Animation Events are stored, as individual events or grouped up and listened through `OnAnimationEvent(string)`.
