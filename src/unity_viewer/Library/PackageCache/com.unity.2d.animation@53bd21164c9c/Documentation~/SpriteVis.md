The panel appears on the right-side of the editor window. It has two sliders at the top that control the visibility of the ![](images/bone_icon.png) bones and ![](images/mesh_icon.png) Sprite meshes within the editor window. Move either slider further to the left to decrease the visibility of the bones or meshes respectively, and to the right to increase their visibility.

The **Bone** tab displays the [Bone hierarchy](#bone-tab-and-hierarchy-tree) of the character Prefab. The **Sprite** tab displays the names of the Sprites and their grouping hierarchy.

## Bone tab and hierarchy tree

![](images/bone_tree.png)<br/>The Bone tab selected.

Select the __Bone__ tab to view the list of bones in the character Prefab. The list reflects the hierarchy of bones you created with the [Bone tools](SkinEdToolsShortcuts.html#bone-tools). You can reparent and reorder bones directly from the bone tab by dragging selected bones up and down the list. Toggle the visibility of each bone by selecting the ![](images/visibility_icon.png) icon next to it.

## Sprite tab

Select the __Sprite tab__ to see the list of Sprites that make up the character Prefab in the Skinning editor window. The names  and order of the Sprites mirror their names, layer and grouping order in the original source file. Toggle the visibility of a Layer by selecting the ![](images/visibility_icon.png) icon next to it. Hold Alt (macOS: hold Option) to view it in isolation and hide every other Layer.
