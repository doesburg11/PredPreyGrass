# Delete tracks

Delete a track to remove its track header, clips, blends, and properties. This is a destructive action that modifies a Timeline asset and affects all Timeline instances based on the Timeline asset.

There are many ways to delete a track:
* Select a track and press the **Delete** key (MacOS: hold **Command** and press **Delete**).
* In the Track Header, select **Delete** from the More (â‹®) menu.
* Right-click a track and choose **Delete** from the context menu.

Deleting an Animation track also deletes the recorded Infinite clips for Animation clips that were converted from Infinite clips. The Project window may still display recorded Infinite clips as children of a Timeline asset because it is not updated until you save the Scene or Project.

You cannot delete a locked track.
