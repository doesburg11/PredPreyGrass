# Track properties

Use the Inspector window to change the name of a track and its properties. The available properties depend on the type of track selected.

For example, select an Animation track to set how track offsets are applied, use an avatar mask, and select which transforms are modified when matching offsets between Animation clips.

Not all tracks have properties. See the following topics for tracks with properties:
* [Activation Track properties](insp-trk-act.md)
* [Animation Track properties](insp-trk-anim.md)
* [Audio Track properties](insp-trk-audio.md)
