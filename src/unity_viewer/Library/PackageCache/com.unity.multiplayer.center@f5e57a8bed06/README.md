# Multiplayer Center

The Multiplayer Center provides a starting point to create multiplayer games of all types. It starts by asking you a range of questions to identify your needs. It will then recommend and install a range of packages to help get you started. The Multiplayer Center provides interactive guidance and a rich selection of resources to help you experiment with all the new tools that are now part of the Multiplayer end-to-end experience.

The Unity Multiplayer Center is added as a default package for a short period until it becomes a core module. We are integrating the lightweight Multiplayer Center directly into the Unity Editor to enhance your game development experience.

Open the Unity Multiplayer Center window by selecting **Window** > **Multiplayer** > **Multiplayer Center**.
