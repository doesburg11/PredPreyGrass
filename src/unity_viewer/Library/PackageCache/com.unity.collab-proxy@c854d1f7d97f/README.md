# Unity Version Control Package

This package provides an in-editor interface for teams to work with [Unity Version Control](https://unity.com/solutions/version-control) (Unity VCS), our leading version control solution, directly in Unity.

_Note that this project is the natural evolution of the old Collaborate package, hence its technical name "collab-proxy"._

[Documentation](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/devops/manual/vcs-plugins/unityeditor-plugin/unity-version-control-package) - [Changelog](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.collab-proxy@2.8/changelog/CHANGELOG.html)

## Compatibility

The minimum supported version of the Unity Editor is 2021.3.0f1 LTS.

Windows and macOS are officially supported, not Linux.

The solution is exclusively targeting .NetStandard 2.0, and will not work with the legacy Mono runtime.
