### Predator, Prey, Grass PettingZoo environment
 
 This model simulates a predator-prey relationship in a grid (intially bounded) environment. The population consists of wolf packs (predators) and sheep herds (prey). The predators gain energy from consuming prey, and the sheep gain energy from consuming grass (a primary producer). The Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm to control the environment is PPO from stable baselines3.
