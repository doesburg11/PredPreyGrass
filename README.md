### Explanation of the agents, the environment and the learning algorithm

A multi-agent reinforcement learning environment trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed. Predators (red) and Prey (blue) both expend energy moving around, and replenish it by eating. Prey eat Grass (green), and Predators eat Prey if they end up on the same grid cell. This simulation represents a predator-prey-grass ecosystem within a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Agents,  Predators and Prey, learn to execute movement actions based on their partially observable environment to maximize cumulative reward. The environment is a bounded grid world and the agents move within a Von Neumann neighborhood.

The model demonstrates for instance:
- Bounded grid environment
- Three agent types: Predator, Prey and Grass
- Two learning agent types: Predator and Prey, learning to move in a Von Neumann neighborhood
- Learning agents have partially observations of the entire model state; Prey can see farther than Predators
- Learned behavior of Predators and Prey as such to avoid being eaten or starving to death
- Predators and Prey loose energy due to movement and homeostasis
- Grass gains energy due to photosynthesis
- Dynamically removing agents from the grid when eaten (Prey and Grass) or starving to death (Predator and Prey)
- Grass is removed from grid after being eaten by prey, but regrows at the same spot after a certain number of steps 
- Episode ends when either all Predators or all Prey are dead
- Restricted to one similar agent type per cell


High-level breakdown of the algorithm's ```step``` function:

1. **Predator Actions**: If the agent is a Predator and it's alive, it checks if the Predator has positive energy. If it does, the Predator moves and the model state is updated. If the predator lands on a cell with prey, it selects the prey to eat and to be removed at the end of a cycle (AEC). Otherwise, if the Predator has no positive energy left, it is being selected to become inactive at the end of a cycle. 

2. **Prey Actions**: If the agent is a prey and it's alive, it checks if the prey has positive energy. If it does, the prey moves and the model state is updated. If the prey lands on a cell with grass it selects the grass to eat and to be removed ath the end of a cycle. If the prey has no energy left, it is being selected to become inactive at the end of a cycle.

3. **End of Cycle Actions**: If it's the last step in the PettingZoo cycle (AEC), the function removes agents that have starved to death or have been eaten, and updates the rewards for the remaining agents. It also increments the number of cycles. If the energy of an agent (Predator or Prey) has reached a certain replication-treshold it reproduces a new agent at a random empty spot in the grid environment and the parent transfers a part of its energy to the child.

This algorithm is an example of how elaborate behaviors can emerge from simple rules in agent-based models. Each agent (Predator, Prey, Grass) follows simple rules based on its current state, but the interactions between agents can lead to more complex dynamics at the ecosystem level.

### Emergent Behavior
The trained agents are displaying a classic Lotkaâ€“Volterra pattern over time:

To evaluate and visualize after training follow instructions in:
```pettingzoo/predpreygrass/evaluate_from_file.py```

### The AEC Environment Architecture

Due to unexpected behavior when agents terminate during a simulation in PettingZoo AEC (https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo/issues/713), we modified the architecture. The 'AECEnv.agents' array remains unchanged after agent death or creation. The removal of agents is managed by 'PredPrey.predator_instance_list' and `PredPreyGrass.[predator/prey]_instance_list`. The active status of agents is furthermore tracked by the boolean attribute `alive` of the agents. Optionally, a number of agents have this attribute `alive` set to `False` at `reset`, which gives room for creation of agents during run time. If so, the agents are (re)added to `PredPreyGrass.[predator/prey]_instance_list`.

This architecture provides an alternative to the unexpected behavior of individual agents terminating during simulation in the standard PettingZoo API and circumvents the PPO-algorithm's requirement of an unchanged number of agents during training. In that sense it is comparable to SuperSuit's "Black Death" wrapper.

### Optionalities of the PredPreyGrass AEC Environment
The benchmark configuration used in the gif-video :
- `max_cycles=10000`
- `x_grid_size=16`
- `y_grid_size=16`
- `n_predator=6`
- `n_prey=8`
- `n_grass=30`
- `max_observation_range=7` (must be odd)
- `obs_range_predator=5` (must be odd)  
- `obs_range_prey=7` (must be odd)
- `action_range=3` (must be odd)
- `energy_loss_per_step_predator=-0.1`
- `energy_loss_per_step_prey=-0.05`
- `initial_energy_predator=5.0`
- `initial_energy_prey=5.0`
- `catch_grass_reward=3.0` (for prey)
- `catch_prey_reward=5.0` (for predator)
- `pixel_scale=40`

This implementation supports different observation ranges per agent: If `obs_range < max_observation_range`, the 'outer layers' of observations are set to zero.
