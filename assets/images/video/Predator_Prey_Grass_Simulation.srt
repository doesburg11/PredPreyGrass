00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,700
Welcome to Predator Prey Grass

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,520
a multi agent simulation where survival

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,240
competition

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,020
and evolution unfold in a dynamic digital ecosystem

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,300
In this grid world

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,060
two types of agents roam the environment

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,320
Red circles represent predators

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,380
and blue diamonds represent prey

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,020
The green non moving squares represent grass

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,300
the primary food source for prey

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,260
Agents need energy to stay alive

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,100
Predators hunt prey

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,380
and prey search for grass in order to survive

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,660
Ultimately agents are rewarded when they reproduce

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,320
To achieve this they learn to optimize their movement

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,220
using multi agent reinforcement learning

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,280
a type of artificial intelligence

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,380
powered by neural networks

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,640
Reproduction

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,200
occurs only when agents collect enough energy

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,620
through eating Initially

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,760
all agents can only move one step at a time

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,940
This creates a delicate balance

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,740
a dynamic tug of war between predators and prey

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,360
But evolution is in play With every reproduction

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,500
there's a tiny chance of mutation

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,260
creating offspring that can move faster

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,360
These faster individuals gain a competitive edge

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,880
reaching prey or grass

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,300
more efficiently than their slower peers

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,020
Over time the trait spreads

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,220
You'll notice darker colored agents taking over

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,380
These are the faster mutants

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,100
Even with only a small chance of mutation

35
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,580
and equal odds of reverting to slow

36
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,760
the faster agents begin to dominate

37
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,920
the populations of both predators

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,980
and prey

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,160
This is a combination of Learned behavior

40
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,140
and genetic adaptation

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,220
Through rewards and consequences

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,820
agents learn how to survive

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,900
What emerges is an open ended evolutionary arms race

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,540
complex unpredictable and endlessly Fascinating

45
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,600
Curious to explore more Check out the Github repository

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,840
to see the code behind this evolving world

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,540
and maybe help shape the next emergent trait
