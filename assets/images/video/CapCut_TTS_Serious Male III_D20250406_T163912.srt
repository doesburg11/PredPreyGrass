00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,940
Welcome to Predator Prey Grass

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,760
a multi agent simulation where survival

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,480
competition

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,380
and evolution play out in a dynamic digital ecosystem

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,300
In this grid world

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,220
two types of agents roam the environment

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,420
Red circles are predators and blue diamonds are prey

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,780
Green squares that's grass

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,980
the food source for prey And those arrows

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,820
they show each agent's direction of movement

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,240
Predators hunt prey pray

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,540
search for grass

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,080
Both learn to optimize their behavior using multi agent

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,640
reinforcement learning

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,200
a type of artificial intelligence

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,260
powered by neural networks

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,040
At first agents know nothing

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,700
They move randomly

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,500
driven only by the chance of reproduction

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,400
Reproduction happens when agents collect enough energy

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,740
by eating But be warned

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,620
energy is consumed with every move

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,660
and when energy runs out they die

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,400
Initially all agents can only move one step at a time

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,500
This creates a delicate balance

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,180
a dynamic tug of war between predators and prey

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,520
But evolution is in play With every reproduction

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,620
there's a tiny chance for mutation

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,340
creating a child that can move faster

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,360
These faster offspring gain a competitive edge

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,240
reaching prey

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,260
or grass more efficiently than their slower peers

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,100
Over time the trait spreads

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,420
You'll notice darker colored agents taking over

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,620
These are the faster mutants

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,540
Even with only a small chance of mutation

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,820
and equal odds of reverting to slow

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,740
the faster agents begin to dominate

39
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,780
No one tells agents what to do

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,620
Through rewards and consequences

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,700
they learn how to survive

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,460
What emerges is an open ended Evolutionary dance

43
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,860
complex unpredictable and endlessly fascinating

44
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,560
Curious to explore more Check out the Github repository

45
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,840
to see the code behind this evolving world

46
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,540
and maybe help shape the next emergent trait
