This script trains a multi-agent environment with PPO using Ray RLlib ne API stack.
It uses a custom environment that simulates a predator-prey-grass ecosystem.
The environment is a grid world where predators and prey move around.
Predators try to catch prey, and prey try to eat grass.
The environment is implemented in the file predpreygrass/rllib/predpreygrass_rllib_env_moore_speed.py.
The environment configuration is in the file predpreygrass/rllib/config_env.py.

This implements MultiRLModuleSpec explicitly to define the policies for predators and prey.
