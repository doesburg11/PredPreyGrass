# predator_sexual_reproduction

A copy of [`base_environment_step_energy`](../base_environment_step_energy/) that
replaces asexual predator reproduction with **sexual (two-parent) reproduction**,
and splits predators into two sexed policies with different foraging roles.

## Research motivation

Predators, not prey, are the human analog in this module. The project's
broader interest is human cooperation and behavior; predators are cast as
"humans" here because humans hunt *and* gather fruit, whereas herbivore prey
don't map onto that. Two features are specifically included as human-like
traits under study, not just mechanics:

- **Sexual reproduction** (a mate requirement, not solo energy-threshold
  reproduction), with asymmetric parental investment (see below), as a
  substrate for pair-bonding-like dynamics.
- **Risk-driven division of labor by sex** -- both sexes can hunt, but face
  very different odds (see "Why hunting is risky, and riskier for females"
  below), so any resulting specialization is meant to emerge from training,
  not be hardcoded by fiat -- a precondition many theories of human
  cooperation lean on.

This is why predators were chosen over prey for this feature despite prey
being the easier population to test it on (denser, more frequent mating
opportunities, no interaction with the hunting/engagement code path) --
prey have no analogous role in a human-cooperation framing.

## The mechanism

- **predator_male**: low-risk/high-success hunter (90% success / 5% death per
  attempt by default), also gathers fruit.
- **predator_female**: high-risk/low-success hunter (20% success / 10% death
  per attempt by default), also gathers fruit.
- **prey**: unchanged from `base_environment_step_energy` -- only eats grass,
  reproduces asexually (solo, energy-threshold triggered).

Grass is prey-exclusive food; fruit is predator-exclusive food (both sexes can
gather it). This keeps predator and prey foraging from ever competing over
the same patches, unlike `eco_evolutionary_nuptial_gift`'s predator_female
(which deliberately competes with prey for grass).

### Sexual reproduction

A `predator_male` and a `predator_female` reproduce together when:

1. Both **independently** clear `predator_creation_energy_threshold`.
2. They are within `mate_search_radius` (Chebyshev distance) of each other.

This can never be an exact-cell match, unlike predator-catches-prey or
prey-eats-grass: `predator_male`/`predator_female` share one grid layer
(channel 1, "predator"), and movement collision already forbids two
predators -- of either sex -- from ever occupying the same cell. A radius
check is therefore structurally required, not just a design preference.
This is the same constraint `eco_evolutionary_nuptial_gift`'s
`cooperation_range` (male → female nuptial gift) faces, and is modeled on it.

Unlike the nuptial-gift module, reproduction itself is genuinely two-parent
here: both parents pay energy, both get the reproduction reward, and a single
offspring (sex assigned by an unbiased coin flip) is spawned adjacent to the
**female** (the mate). There is no genome in this module (it's a
`non_evolutionary/` module, mirroring `base_environment_step_energy`) --
"sexual" here means the two-parent *mechanic* (mate-finding, joint energy
cost, joint reward), not genetic recombination.

**Birth cost is split asymmetrically**: the female pays 90% and the male
pays 10% of the offspring's starting energy by default
(`predator_birth_cost_share_female`/`_male`), modeled on parental investment
theory (Trivers, 1972) -- the female bears the larger share of the shared
reproductive cost, consistent with her also being the structurally riskier
forager (see below).

### Why hunting is risky, and riskier for females

Hunting is a 3-outcome stochastic contest for **both** sexes, resolved
whenever a predator shares a cell with a prey (`_resolve_hunting_attempt`):

1. **success** -- the predator eats the prey (same bookkeeping as a
   deterministic catch would have).
2. **predator dies** -- the prey is left completely unharmed; the predator
   itself is removed, using the same bookkeeping as starvation.
3. **failure** -- nothing happens; the predator can still separately gather
   fruit that step.

`predator_male` gets favorable odds (90% success / 5% death by default);
`predator_female` gets unfavorable odds (20% success / 10% death by default).
This reverses the module's original design, where `predator_female` was
*structurally incapable* of touching prey at all -- now both sexes have the
same capability, and any tendency for females to lean on fruit-gathering
instead of hunting is meant to be an **emergent consequence of RL training**
under this risk asymmetry, not a hardcoded rule. Whether training actually
produces that specialization is an open empirical question (see Status).

## Grid channels

`num_obs_channels = 5`: Border, Predator (both sexes share this layer),
Prey, Grass, Fruit.

## Config (see `config_env.py`)

Energy costs (`homeostatic_energy_cost_per_step_*`, `move_energy_cost_per_step_*`)
are inherited unchanged from `base_environment_step_energy`'s validated
defaults. New keys: `mate_search_radius` (default `3`), `n_possible_predator_male`/
`n_possible_predator_female` (replacing the single `n_possible_predators` pool),
`n_initial_active_predator_male`/`n_initial_active_predator_female`,
`initial_energy_predator_male`/`initial_energy_predator_female`, the
`initial_num_fruit`/`initial_energy_fruit`/`energy_gain_per_step_fruit` fruit
settings (same shape as the grass settings),
`predator_birth_cost_share_female`/`_male` (default `0.9`/`0.1`),
`penalty_predator_death_in_combat` (default `0.0`), and the hunting-odds keys
`prey_vs_predator_male_success_prob`/`_death_prob` (default `0.90`/`0.05`)
and `prey_vs_predator_female_success_prob`/`_death_prob` (default
`0.20`/`0.10`). `__init__` raises `ValueError` if a sex's success+death
probabilities exceed 1.0.

## Running

Train:
```
python -m predpreygrass.non_evolutionary.predator_sexual_reproduction.tune_ppo_predator_sexual_reproduction --seed 42 --max-iters 500
```

Watch a random policy (sanity check, no training needed):
```
python -m predpreygrass.non_evolutionary.predator_sexual_reproduction.random_policy
```

Evaluate a checkpoint interactively:
```
python -m predpreygrass.non_evolutionary.predator_sexual_reproduction.evaluate_ppo_from_checkpoint_debug
```
(update the hardcoded `checkpoint_path` first).

Run the validation test suite (not auto-discovered by the repo's pytest
`testpaths` -- must be invoked explicitly, same as every other module's tests):
```
pytest predpreygrass/non_evolutionary/predator_sexual_reproduction/tests/ -v
```

## Status

Freshly scaffolded (2026-09-17), probabilistic combat + asymmetric
reproduction added (2026-09-18) -- smoke-tested via the unit test suite,
a random-policy run, and a local PPO build/train iteration, not yet trained
for real. Open questions for a first real run: whether `mate_search_radius=3`
gives frequent-enough mating opportunities at this module's population
density (see `base_environment_step_energy/RESULTS.md` for the equilibrium
~24-29 prey / ~12-14 predators baseline this module inherits its costs
from -- predator count there wasn't split by sex, so the per-sex equilibrium
here is untested); whether the 90/10 birth-cost split needs retuning; and
the central empirical question this module now exists to test -- **does
training actually produce male-hunts/female-gathers specialization from the
90/5 vs 20/10 success/death odds, or does the risk asymmetry turn out not to
be enough to drive it?**
