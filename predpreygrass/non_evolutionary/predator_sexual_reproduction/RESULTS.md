# Predator Sexual Reproduction — Training Results

Results from PPO training runs on the `predator_sexual_reproduction` environment. See
`README.md` for the mechanism design (sexed predators, mate-search + energy-threshold
reproduction, stochastic hunting, nuptial-gift provisioning, parental care) and the
human-cooperation framing behind it.

This is a running research log, not just a final write-up — it records the trial-and-error
trail (what was tried, why, what was found) so the search can be re-evaluated later without
reconstructing it from conversation history.

## Iteration log

### Iteration 0 — Positive control, extreme hunting-risk asymmetry (complete)

**Config:** `PPO_PREDATOR_SEXUAL_REPRODUCTION_POSITIVE_CONTROL_SEED42`, seed 42, 100 iterations,
4 env runners. Hunting odds pushed to an extreme via the CLI overrides added for this purpose
(`tune_ppo_predator_sexual_reproduction.py`'s `--male-success-prob`/`--male-death-prob`/
`--female-success-prob`/`--female-death-prob`): male 95% success / 2% death, female 5% success /
90% death per hunting attempt. Everything else at shipped defaults (`mate_search_radius=3`,
`predator_birth_cost_share_female/_male=0.9/0.1`, `male_gift_donation_rate=0.3`,
`parent_offspring_share_rate=0.2`, initial population 6 male / 10 female predators / 8 prey).

**Purpose:** confirm the risk-driven male/female specialization mechanism *can* produce a
visible signal at all, before trusting a null result at realistic (much less extreme) odds.

**Result: the extreme killed the mechanism outright rather than stress-testing it.**
`hunting_success_rate_predator_male`/`_female` tracked the configured 95%/5% almost exactly
(0.956 / 0.047 at iteration 100) — the hunting-outcome code is wired correctly. But at a 90%
death chance per failed hunt, a female's expected survival is ~1 hunting attempt
(`1/0.9 ≈ 1.1`). With only 10 starting females, the female population went functionally extinct
in essentially **every single episode, from iteration 1 onward, and never recovered**:

| Iteration | Female hunting attempts | Female hunting deaths | Final # females | Female-extinct episode rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5.5 | 5.5 | 0.0 | 100% |
| 25 | 9.8 | 8.3 | 0.0 | 100% |
| 50 | 10.2 | 9.1 | 0.0 | 100% |
| 75 | 10.3 | 9.5 | 0.0 | 100% |
| 100 | 10.3 | 9.0 | 0.0 | 100% |

PPO never learned to keep females out of hunting despite the near-certain lethality — female
hunting attempts per episode actually *rose* slightly over training (5.5 → 10.3), not fell.

**Consequence: predator reproduction essentially never happens.** `births_predator_male` and
`births_predator_female` bounce around 0–0.3 per episode across training with no trend, landing
at exactly **0.0 at iteration 100**. Zero mate-gift events, zero parental-care events throughout
the run — both require a live mated pair, which this config almost never produces since females
die before pairing/reproduction can occur.

**Interpretation:** this specific odds combination is degenerate, not merely "extreme." A 90%
per-attempt death probability is closer to a guaranteed-death rule than a bad-expected-value bet
— it removes the female population before any specialization behavior, mating, or parental
investment has a chance to be observed, and gives PPO no time window in which avoiding hunting
would even matter (most females are already dead by the point avoidance could be learned). This
is **not evidence against the sexual-reproduction/specialization design** — it's evidence this
particular odds pairing is unsuitable for testing it. A milder female death probability (bad
expected value, survivable in the short-to-medium term) is needed to actually observe whether
PPO can learn male/female specialization while both sexes survive long enough to reproduce.

**Status:** complete, 100/100 iterations, no crashes. Raw data:
`~/simulation_results/ray_results/PPO_PREDATOR_SEXUAL_REPRODUCTION_POSITIVE_CONTROL_SEED42/`.

**Adjustment → Iteration 1 (not yet run):** retry the positive control with a less extreme
female death probability — enough to make hunting a clearly bad bet without being near-certain
death on first attempt (e.g. in the 20-40% range rather than 90%) — and check whether female
population survives long enough for any births/gifts/parental-care events to occur at all before
drawing conclusions about specialization.

## Next steps

1. **Re-run the positive control with a survivable female death probability** (see Iteration 0's
   adjustment above) — the immediate next experiment.
2. Once a config produces at least some predator births, extend the analysis to the
   specialization question the positive control was actually designed to answer: do males and
   females diverge in hunting-attempt rate / fruit-gathering rate in a way that tracks their
   respective risk profiles, and does that hold at realistic (non-extreme) odds too?
3. Real (non-positive-control) run at the module's default/realistic hunting odds has not yet
   been attempted — still open per the module's own README "Not yet trained for real" status
   note as of the mate-search-radius/gift-restriction/parental-care design being finalized.
