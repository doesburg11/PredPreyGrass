# Predator Sexual Reproduction — Training Results

Results from PPO training runs on the `predator_sexual_reproduction` environment. See
`README.md` for the mechanism design (sexed predators, mate-search + energy-threshold
reproduction, stochastic hunting, nuptial-gift provisioning, parental care) and the
human-cooperation framing behind it.

This is a running research log, not just a final write-up — it records the trial-and-error
trail (what was tried, why, what was found) so the search can be re-evaluated later without
reconstructing it from conversation history.

## Iteration log

### Iteration 0 — Positive control, extreme hunting-risk asymmetry (complete)

**Config:** `PPO_PREDATOR_SEXUAL_REPRODUCTION_POSITIVE_CONTROL_SEED42`, seed 42, 100 iterations,
4 env runners. Hunting odds pushed to an extreme via the CLI overrides added for this purpose
(`tune_ppo_predator_sexual_reproduction.py`'s `--male-success-prob`/`--male-death-prob`/
`--female-success-prob`/`--female-death-prob`): male 95% success / 2% death, female 5% success /
90% death per hunting attempt. Everything else at shipped defaults (`mate_search_radius=3`,
`predator_birth_cost_share_female/_male=0.9/0.1`, `male_gift_donation_rate=0.3`,
`parent_offspring_share_rate=0.2`, initial population 6 male / 10 female predators / 8 prey).

**Why this module tests division of labor at all:** predators (not prey) were chosen as this
module's human analog specifically because humans hunt *and* gather while prey have no
equivalent role (see README.md's "Research motivation"). The male-hunts+gathers/
female-gathers-only split that predated this module's current design was replaced with a
symmetric hunting ability plus a hard-coded risk asymmetry (males safer, females riskier at
hunting), grounded in Trivers (1972) parental investment theory: the sex with more at stake in
reproduction (here, females via the 90/10 birth-cost split and the sole gestational-style
energy investment) should be more risk-averse. The design bet is that PPO training will *learn*
male/female behavioral specialization (males hunt more, females gather more) as an emergent
response to that risk asymmetry, rather than the specialization being hard-coded as a structural
incapability the way it was in an earlier design (see README.md's mechanism history).

**Purpose of this specific run:** before trusting a *null* result at the real, much milder risk
asymmetry (module defaults: male 90%/5%, female 20%/10%, see Iteration 1 below), first confirm
the mechanism is even *capable* of producing a visible specialization signal at all, at an odds
gradient sharp enough that if training can't produce a signal even here, it almost certainly
can't at the real, subtler odds either. This is the same "positive control before trusting a
null" logic used in `predpreygrass/evolutionary/eco_evolutionary_metabolic_rate/RESULTS.md`'s
Iteration 6 (sharpen the fitness gradient before concluding a trait lacks selective leverage).

**Result: the extreme killed the mechanism outright rather than stress-testing it.**
`hunting_success_rate_predator_male`/`_female` tracked the configured 95%/5% almost exactly
(0.956 / 0.047 at iteration 100) — the hunting-outcome code is wired correctly. But at a 90%
death chance per failed hunt, a female's expected survival is ~1 hunting attempt
(`1/0.9 ≈ 1.1`). With only 10 starting females, the female population went functionally extinct
in essentially **every single episode, from iteration 1 onward, and never recovered**:

| Iteration | Female hunting attempts | Female hunting deaths | Final # females | Female-extinct episode rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5.5 | 5.5 | 0.0 | 100% |
| 25 | 9.8 | 8.3 | 0.0 | 100% |
| 50 | 10.2 | 9.1 | 0.0 | 100% |
| 75 | 10.3 | 9.5 | 0.0 | 100% |
| 100 | 10.3 | 9.0 | 0.0 | 100% |

PPO never learned to keep females out of hunting despite the near-certain lethality — female
hunting attempts per episode actually *rose* slightly over training (5.5 → 10.3), not fell.

**Consequence: predator reproduction essentially never happens.** `births_predator_male` and
`births_predator_female` bounce around 0–0.3 per episode across training with no trend, landing
at exactly **0.0 at iteration 100**. Zero mate-gift events, zero parental-care events throughout
the run — both require a live mated pair, which this config almost never produces since females
die before pairing/reproduction can occur.

**Interpretation:** this specific odds combination is degenerate, not merely "extreme." A 90%
per-attempt death probability is closer to a guaranteed-death rule than a bad-expected-value bet
— it removes the female population before any specialization behavior, mating, or parental
investment has a chance to be observed, and gives PPO no time window in which avoiding hunting
would even matter (most females are already dead by the point avoidance could be learned). This
is **not evidence against the sexual-reproduction/specialization design** — it's evidence this
particular odds pairing is unsuitable for testing it. A milder female death probability (bad
expected value, survivable in the short-to-medium term) is needed to actually observe whether
PPO can learn male/female specialization while both sexes survive long enough to reproduce.

**Status:** complete, 100/100 iterations, no crashes. Raw data:
`~/simulation_results/ray_results/PPO_PREDATOR_SEXUAL_REPRODUCTION_POSITIVE_CONTROL_SEED42/`.

**Adjustment → Iteration 1 (launched):** rather than invent a new synthetic intermediate death
probability, use the module's own already-established realistic defaults directly — they're
already far milder than the positive control's 90% (10% female death per attempt, ~10-attempt
expected survival vs. ~1.1) and answer the module's actual research question rather than another
calibration step. No new number needed; `config_env.py`'s shipped values already are the
"survivable but bad-expected-value" config the positive control's null result called for.

### Iteration 1 — Realistic (shipped-default) odds, first real run (running)

**Config:** `PPO_PREDATOR_SEXUAL_REPRODUCTION_REALISTIC_SEED42`, seed 42, 100 iterations, same
population/env-runner setup as Iteration 0, but **no hunting-probability CLI overrides** — falls
through to `config_env.py`'s shipped defaults: male 90% success / 5% death, female 20% success /
10% death per hunting attempt. This is simultaneously the fix for Iteration 0's extinction
problem and the first-ever real (non-positive-control) training run for this module — the
module's README has said "not yet trained for real" since 2026-09-17.

**Launched:** 2026-09-19 09:00, via `systemd-run --user` (unit
`predator-sexual-repro-realistic-seed42.service`, detached from any terminal/IDE session).

**Status:** running. Results to be added here once complete.

## Next steps

1. **Iteration 1 is running** — the real/shipped-default config, first non-positive-control run
   for this module. Results pending.
2. Once Iteration 1 completes, check first whether females survive at all this time (the
   Iteration 0 failure mode) before looking at the actual specialization question: do males and
   females diverge in hunting-attempt rate / fruit-gathering rate in a way that tracks their
   respective risk profiles?
3. If Iteration 1 shows a promising trend but 100 iterations isn't enough to see it clearly,
   extend `--max-iters` (e.g. to 300, matching the `step_energy` sweep's scale) rather than
   drawing conclusions from an under-trained run.
