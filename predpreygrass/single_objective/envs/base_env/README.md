## so_predpreygrass_base.py
Defines a multi-agent learning environment called `PredPreyGrass`, which simulates interactions between predators, prey, and grass. This environment is designed to model energy transfer dynamics where predators gain energy by eating prey, and prey gain energy by eating grass. The environment is built using the `gymnasium` library and includes various configurations and parameters to control the simulation.

The `PredPreyGrass` class initializes the environment with a grid of specified size and sets up the initial conditions for the agents, including their energy levels, observation ranges, and spawning areas. The class also defines various constants and parameters such as the number of possible predators, prey, and grass, as well as rewards and energy gains associated with different actions.


The `reset`function reinitializes the environment, clearing all agent lists and resetting energy levels and other metrics. It also creates new agents and places them on the grid, ensuring that the initial conditions are met.

The `step` function handles the actions of agents during each simulation step. It updates the agents' positions, checks for interactions such as predators catching prey or prey eating grass, and manages the energy levels and rewards for each agent. At the end of each cycle, it resets rewards and updates the state of the environment, including the creation of new agents if certain conditions are met.

The `move_agent`function updates the position of an agent based on the given action and adjusts the grid state accordingly. The `earmarking_predator_catches_prey` and `earmarking_prey_eats_grass` functions handle the bookkeeping for when a predator catches prey or a prey eats grass, respectively.

The `reset_rewards`function resets the reward dictionary for all agents, while the `remove_predator`, `remove_prey`, and `remove_grass` functions handle the removal of agents from the environment when they starve to death or are eaten.

The `create_new_predator` and `create_new_prey` functions create new predator and prey agents, respectively, when the energy levels of parent agents exceed a certain threshold. These functions also update the grid state and agent lists accordingly.

The `position_new_agent_on_gridworld`function is responsible for placing a new agent on the grid within its designated spawning area, ensuring that the chosen cell is not already occupied by another agent of the same type. This function returns a random available position for the new agent.


The `reward_predator` and `reward_prey` functions update the rewards and energy levels for predators and prey based on their actions and interactions during the simulation.

The `reset_removal_records` function resets the records for agent removals at the end of each cycle, ensuring that the environment is ready for the next cycle.

The `observe` function generates observations for a given agent, providing information about the surrounding grid cells within the agent's observation range. The `render` function visualizes the environment using the `pygame` library, drawing the grid, agents, and energy levels on the screen.

## so_predpreygrass.py

Calls an instance of PredPreyGrass from `so_predpreygrass_base.py`, according to the `pettingzoo` protocol. Defines a multi-agent environment for a predator-prey-grass simulation using the`gymnasium` and `pettingzoo` libraries. The environment is encapsulated in the `raw_env` class, which inherits from `AECEnv` and `EzPickle`. This class is designed to manage the interactions between agents (predators, prey, and grass) within a grid-based world.

The `raw_env` class metadata specifies rendering modes, the environment name, parallelizability, and frames per second for rendering. The `__init__`method initializes the environment, setting up the rendering mode, initializing `pygame`, and creating an instance of the `PredPreyGrass` environment. It also sets up the list of agents, their action spaces, and observation spaces.

The `reset` method reinitializes the environment, optionally seeding the random number generator. It resets the agent list, action spaces, observation spaces, and various dictionaries for rewards, terminations, truncations, and additional information. It also reinitializes the agent selector and calls the `reset` method of the `PredPreyGrass` environment.

The `close` method ensures that the environment is properly closed, while the `render` method calls the `render` method of the `PredPreyGrass` environment to visualize the current state. The `step` method processes actions taken by agents, updates their states, checks for terminations or truncations, and accumulates rewards. It also handles rendering if the environment is in "human" mode.

The `observe` method retrieves observations for a given agent, ensuring that inactive agents receive zeroed observations. The `observation_space` and `action_space` methods return the respective spaces for a given agent, facilitating interaction with the environment.

Overall, this code provides a framework for simulating and managing a multi-agent predator-prey-grass environment, leveraging the capabilities of `gymnasium` and `pettingzoo`to handle agent interactions and environment dynamics.
