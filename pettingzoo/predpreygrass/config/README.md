### Configurations

The simplified configuration`config_pettingzoo_benchmark_1.py` is utilized in the video below.  It is used to demonstrate the strategy of Predators hovering around Grass to wait for incoming Prey, when no Prey is in the Predator's observation range. An example of this behavior is shown in the video above by Predator number 0, who is hovering around at grass number 26, 31 and 41 before it is going after Prey number 12, when it enters the observation range of Predator 0.
