### Configurations

The benchmark configuration `config_pettingzoo_benchmark.py` is, somewhat arbitrarily, to test new developments in the environment. It is the same configuration used in an early stage of the environment some time ago and is displayed on the front page of the repository. It is used to test if it is still performing as expected when devoloping new features, such as for example creating new learning agents (Predator and Prey) or regrowing Grass agents.
